# Lending Club Case Study

This is an EDA project.

## Problem & Objective 
Analysis of data using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis ) to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

## Benefits
Identification of risky loan applicants resulting in reducing the amount of credit loss. 

## Learning
Solving this assignment will give us an idea about how real business problems are solved using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In this case study, apart from applying the techniques we have learnt in EDA, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
